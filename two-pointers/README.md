# Two Pointers
This section will contain Two Pointers pattern problems.

Imagine two people walking from opposite ends of a street toward each other.
They will keep walking until they either meet or pass each other.

One person = Left pointer

Other person = Right pointer

They stop = Condition is met (like sum = target)

Use this method when:

>The array is sorted

>You’re asked to find pairs or subarrays

>You want to optimize from brute-force (O(n²)) to O(n)
